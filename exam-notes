Legacy Agent: 
  It is monitoring agent. 
  Uses collectd service.
  
Uptime Check:
  It can be public and private uptime. 
  It support HTTP/HTTPS/TCP.
  Target can be, 
      Compute Engine
      Load balancer
      App Engine
      Cloud Run
      Kubernetes Load balancer 

Cloud Trace:  
   It is like app dynamics.
   Used to show the req/res time and latency of different components in microservices. 
   
Billing data recommendation:
  Google recommends billing data as,
    1. Create billing data for separate project. 
    2. Createa bigquery dataset for visualization.
    
Labelling and Grouping resources:
    Network tags - used to manage network traffic to/from VM.
    Labels - Billing breakdown.
    Security marks - for compliance requirement. 
    
Virutal Machine Networking: 
  Network Service tier:
      Premium - Traffic flows to google network and costly. 
      Standard - Traffic uses only entry and exit google point.

Cloud Debugger: 
  Used to find the state of app in real time.
  
Logs to SPlunk:
  Create a destination sink as Splunk and select the pub/sub topic. 

Choose SLI based on SLO:
  Discover what users expect from the system and choose SLIs to measure it.

Store Organizational Log:
  Creata a project and create a logging bucket. 
  Create a log sink from CLI and use --include-children flag (includes all projects in organization).

Factors to consider for data access Log:  
  It will increase log ingestion. 
  Possibility of exceeding log allotment limits. 
  Changing default retention incurs storage cost. 

Blue/Green deployment:
  Spinnaker and Jenkins is used for blue/green deployment. 
  Deployment manager is used for automate deployment of infrastructure. 

Jenkins - Google recommended deployment:
  Google is recommending to deploy Jenkis in Compute Engine and GKE.

Google recommendation for capacity planning:
  Design for graceful degradation.
  Carry out load testing.
  Implement monitoring and alerting.

Prevent Server Overload:
  Queue Management.
  Load shedding and graceful degradation.
  Retries 
  Better to avoid cross layer communication.

To detect vulnarabilities in images:
  Enable vulnarability scanning in container registry and artifact registry. 

VPC Flow logs:
  It captures network flows to/from VM instances and GKE.
  Can use filters in logs. 
  Can enable logs for each subnet level. 
  To capture log flow between pods which require "intranode visibility".
  Can modify logs using record_transformer plugin.
